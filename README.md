# Business-Analysis📊👥

This project focuses on segmenting customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis combined with **K-Means Clustering** to better understand customer behavior and target marketing efforts.

## Key Features:

- **RFM Analysis** 🕒🔄💰: Calculates recency, frequency, and monetary value for each customer, assigning them RFM scores.
- **K-Means Clustering** 🎯: Groups customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Segmentation Insights** 🔍📈: Identifies high-value customers, loyal customers, and those who may need re-engagement.
- **Data Visualization** 📊: Visualizes customer clusters and RFM distributions to facilitate understanding of customer segmentation.

## Tools & Techniques:
- **Python/R** 🐍 for data manipulation and implementation of RFM analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** for K-means clustering.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization.

## Objectives:
- Understand customer behavior through RFM analysis.
- Use clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
